# HMWK5 - (05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler)

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to save daily events for each hour. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I utilized Moment.js while working with the date and time and local storage for persistence. It also has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance:
